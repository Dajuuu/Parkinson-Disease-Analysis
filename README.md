# Parkinson Disease Analysis
Analysis of Parkinson's disease for different age groups and countries using Python. With access to other sources of data, from various countries, I tried to analyse and compare some information about the disease. With help of my research, I tried to answer the following questions:
* Will the number of Parkinson's outbreaks in the coming years increase or not?
* Is there a difference (if so, what) between people living in the UK, Australia, and Canada - Does the geographical latitude and longitude affect the frequency of the disease?
* Comparison of statistics in the countries of Great Britain. Is there a difference in the prevalence of the disease between these countries?
* Discover what symptoms are most common in people with PD
